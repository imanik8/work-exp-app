## 🔧 Configuration

### **API Keys Setup**

The app uses two external APIs for enhanced functionality:

#### **JSearch API (Job Titles Autocomplete)**
- **Purpose:** Provides comprehensive job titles and position suggestions
- **Setup:** 
  1. Get API key from [RapidAPI JSearch](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch)
  2. Create `.env.local` file: `REACT_APP_JSEARCH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
- **Fallback:** App works perfectly without API using 60+ local job titles
- **Usage:** Hybrid approach - fast local search + smart API fallback

#### **Clearbit API (Company Data)**
- **Purpose:** Company logos and information
- **Setup:** No API key required (free tier)
- **Usage:** Automatic company logo fetching

### **Styling Configuration**
- **Tailwind CSS**
  - The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Configuration is in `tailwind.config.js`:
    - Content paths for purging unused styles
    - Custom theme extensions
    - Plugin configurations
- **PostCSS**
  - PostCSS configuration in `postcss.config.js` includes:
    - Tailwind CSS processing
    - Autoprefixer for browser compatibility

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Animations**
  - Fade-in animations for initial page load
  - Slide-up animations for cards and forms
  - Hover effects on interactive elements
  - Smooth transitions between states
- **Color Scheme**
  - Primary: Indigo to purple gradients
  - Secondary: Professional grays and whites
  - Accents: Green for success, red for actions
  - Backgrounds: Subtle gradients from indigo to purple
- **Typography**
  - Headings: Bold, gradient text for emphasis
  - Body: Clean, readable sans-serif
  - Labels: Medium weight for form clarity

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

- **Local storage:** All data is stored in browser memory during the session
- **No external storage:** No data is sent to external servers (except APIs)
- **API usage:** 
  - Clearbit API: Company logo fetching
  - JSearch API: Job titles autocomplete (optional, falls back to local data)
- **Hybrid approach:** Fast local search + smart API fallback for comprehensive results
